#Let's look for a wordpress config

echo WP Config located at $wpconfig
echo WP DB is showing as $wpdb
echo WP User is showing as $wpuser

#Let's update the wordpress config if there is one

#Let's Check the wp-config new output (should be prefixed)

echo WP Config located at $wpconfig
echo WP DB is now showing as $wpdb
echo WP User is now showing as $wpuser

echo Awesome, another site sucessfully migrated
